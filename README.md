# cassava-leaf-disease-ResNet50
This project performs image classification on the Cassava Leaf Disease data set using the pre-trained ResNet50 model to classify a leaf by disease.

The classifications are output to a .csv file where each leaf pictue is classified by a disease ID code.
The overall validation accuracy through the image processing methods used with the ResNet50 pre-trained model was bout 75%. 

This project was developed as part of the CS474 course at the University of Idaho.
